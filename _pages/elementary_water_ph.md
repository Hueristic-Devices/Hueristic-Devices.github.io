pH is a measure of how acidic or basic your water is. Water with a pH of 7 is neutral, while less than 7 is acidic and greater than seven is basic.

BIS specifies a water with pH between 6.5 and 8.5 with no relaxation.

The HD Elementary test uses a standard pH indicator with the app and a colour card. The test has a range between 4 and 10.
