### Tips and troubleshooting for HD Pro


#### No match

If you get a ‘No match’ message on doing the test, it means that the colour of your sample is not within the range that parameter has been calibrated for. This usually occurs when:


**Your reagent has expired.** Check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing.

**You have started using a new reagent without calibrating your phone first.** Click [here](url) for a tutorial on how to calibrate your device.


#### Wrong results

Wrong results could occur for four different reasons.

**Incorrect measurement.** Error in measurement of water sample or reagent or can show up as wrong results. Make sure you measure accurately before testing.

**Contamination of the water sample.** Make sure you wash your apparatus well with distilled water before and after a test.

**Old version of the app.** Make sure you are working with the latest version of the HD Pro app.

**Expired reagents.** Reagents that are past their expiry date can cause changes in the colour of the sample which can lead to a change in results. Make sure to check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing.



### Tips and troubleshooting for HD Elementary


#### What are the ideal lighting condtions to conduct an Elementary test?

Ideally, the test should be conducted in an area amply lit with direct sunlight, with the colour card stand facing the direction of the sunlight.

#### No match

If you get a ‘No match’ message on doing your test, it means that the sample colour is not within the range of the calibration for that parameter. This usually occurs when: 

**Your reagent has expired.** Check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing

**You have started using a new reagent without calibrating your phone first.** Click [here](url) for a tutorial on how to calibrate your device

**you are not testing in a well lit area.** Make sure to test in an area with good natural light and place your stand facing the direction of the sunlight.

#### How to scan the colour card?

#### The colour card isn't getting read

The default ‘Automatic capture mode’ on the app is trained to read colour in optimum brightness conditions. Try moving to a better lit area or an area with direct sunlight to improve lighting conditions.
  
If the card is still not getting read, go to the menu on the top left hand corner of the homepage and click on Settings >> Turn on ‘Manual photo capture’.

This allows you to manually take a picture of the colour card instead of waiting for the app to read it automatically.

( NOTE: The readings taken with ‘Manual capture’ can be slightly different from those taken with ‘Automatic capture’)


#### Wrong results

Wrong results could occur for four reasons:

**Incorrect measurement.** Change in measurements of water sample or reagents can show up as wrong results. Make sure you measure accurately before testing.

**Contamination of the water sample.** Make sure you wash your apparatus well with distilled water before and after a test.

**Old version of the app.** Make sure you are working with the latest version of the HD Elementary app.

**Expired reagents.** Reagents that are past their expiry date can cause changes in the colour of the sample, which can lead to a change in results. Check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing.
