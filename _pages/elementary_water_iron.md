title: Elementary test for Iron in Water
permalink: /elementary_water_iron/

Iron is usually a geogenic contaminant in water, though iron contamination through industrial and other anthropogenic sources cannot be completely ruled out. Excess consumption of iron in water can have deleterious effects on human health, besides giving water a metallic taste and an unpleasant appearance.

The BIS recommends iron content in water to a maximum acceptable limit of 0.3 mg/l.

The HD Elementary test uses 2 reagents and a colour cord with the app to estimate iron in water and has a range of between 0 and 1.5 mg/l.
